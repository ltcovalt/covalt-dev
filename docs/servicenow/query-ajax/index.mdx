description: AJAX script-include for performing arbitrary GlideRecordSecure
    queries. QueryAjax is a thin wrapper for the Query server-side namespace to
    expose methods to client-side scripts. Query results are returned as a JSON
    string.

    This utility should not typically invoked directly. The Query UI script
    exposes a simplified interface, error handling, and response parsing that
    should be used instead.

requires:
    - ServiceNow/Check
env:
    api: QueryAjax
    platform: ServiceNow
    runtime: Client
    resource: Script Include
tags: [api, servicenow, server, query]
