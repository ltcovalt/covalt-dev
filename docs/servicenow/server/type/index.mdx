`Type` is a server-side utility that provides consistent, reusable type-checking
helpers. In addition to basic type checks, like `isString`, `isNumber`, and
`isNil`, this library includes methods for obtaining additional details on a
value when a standard `typeof` check is not sufficient. For example, `Type` can
be used to check if a number is a float or integer, identify an object's
class/prototype, and even identify a limited subset of common Glide Java
classes.
