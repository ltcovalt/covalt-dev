`RecordTree` is a server-side utility for traversing and processing hierarchical
`GlideRecord` relationships. It provides reusable traversal patterns for working
with parent–child and tree structures that would otherwise require repetitive
and error-prone recursive logic. By centralizing recursive traversal logic into
well-defined methods, other scripts can focus on business logic.
