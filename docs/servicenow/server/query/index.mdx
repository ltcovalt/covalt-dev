# Query

`Query` is a server-side namespace responsible for executing secure, read-only
queries using `GlideRecordSecure`, reducing the need for bespoke AJAX scripts to
retrieve server data. Queries are evaluated under the context of the current
user, ensuring access controls and security rules are enforced.

<Alert>
	This namespace primarily exists as an adapter between the `QueryAjax` and
	`GlideRecordSecure` APIs and not usually be invoked directly. The
	[client-side Query](/docs/servicenow/client/query) namespace should
	typically be used instead of directly interfacing with either this API or
	the `QueryAjax` API.
</Alert>

Results are returned as an array of plain JavaScript objects containing only the
explicitly requested fields. This avoids leaking full GlideRecord instances,
keeps responses predictable and serializable, and provides a consistent shape
for downstream consumers.
