import Readme from '@components/TypeDocReadme.astro';

AJAX script-include for performing arbitrary GlideRecordSecure queries.
QueryAjax is a thin wrapper around the
[Query server-side](/docs/servicenow/server/query) namespace used to expose
methods to client-side scripts. Query results are returned as a JSON string.

<Alert>
	This utility should not typically invoked directly. The [Query UI
	script](/docs/servicenow/client/query) exposes a simplified interface, error
	handling, and response parsing that should usually be used when clients
	require access to server data.
</Alert>
