<Alert>
	This utility should not typically invoked directly. The [Query UI
	script](/docs/servicenow/client/query) exposes a simplified interface, error
	handling, and response parsing that should usually be used when clients
	require access to server data.
</Alert>

AJAX script-include for performing arbitrary GlideRecordSecure queries.
QueryAjax is a thin wrapper around the
[server Query](/docs/servicenow/server/query) namespace used to expose methods
to client-side scripts. QueryAjax translates requests from the client, typically
via the [client Query](/docs/servicenow/client/query) namespace, and delegates
them to the server.
