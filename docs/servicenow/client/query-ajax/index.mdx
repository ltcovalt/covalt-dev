# QueryAjax

AJAX script-include for performing arbitrary GlideRecordSecure queries.
QueryAjax is a thin wrapper for the
[Query server-side](/docs/servicenow/server/query) namespace to expose methods
to client-side scripts. Query results are returned as a JSON string.

This utility should not typically invoked directly. The
[Query UI script](/docs/servicenow/client/query) exposes a simplified interface,
error handling, and response parsing that should usually be used when clients
require access to server data.
