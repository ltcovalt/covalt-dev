[Query](../../../README.md) / Query

# Query

Client-side namespace for performing arbitrary GlideRecordSecure queries
without needing a bespoke AJAX script include for each query. The client-side
Query namespace is a wrapper around the QueryAjax utility to improve ease of use
by reducing boilerplate, performing response parsing, and error handling.
