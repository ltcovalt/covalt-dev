`Query` is a client-side utility that wraps the `GlideAjax` AJAX script include
to provide clients with a convenient, safe, and consistent interface for
retrieving server data. The client side `Query` namespace eliminates the need
for consumers to work directly with the `GlideAjax` or create bespoke script
includes to retrieve data from the server.

`Query` delegates execution to the server-side `QueryAjax` implementation, which
performs all queries using `GlideRecordSecure` under the context of the current
user. This ensures all client queries are subject to the same security rules
applied applied to UI transactions.

<Alert>
	This namespace is intended to be the primary entry point for client-side
	data access. Users should rarely need to interact with the `QueryAjax` API
	directly.
</Alert>

On the client, `Query` is responsible for request construction, response
normalization, and error handling. Results are returned as plain JavaScript
objects containing only the explicitly requested fields, making responses
predictable and easy to consume in UI scripts and client-side logic.
