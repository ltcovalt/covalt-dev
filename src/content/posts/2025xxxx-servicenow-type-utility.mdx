I originally started working on a generic AJAX query utility (I'll update this
post with a link when it is ready) when I remembered how tedious and verbose
simple input paramater validation and type checking can be. There's not much to
this utility, so I'll keep this post brief - you can check out the full source
code if you want more detail.
