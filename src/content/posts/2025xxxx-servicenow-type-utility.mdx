I originally started working on a generic AJAX query utility (I'll update this
post with a link when it is ready) when I remembered how tedious and verbose
simple input paramater validation and type checking can be. There's not much to
this utility, so I'll keep this post brief - you can check out the full source
code if you want more detail.

Keep in mind, that although I may use this in some code examples moving forward
(that's why I made it after all), it is entirely unnecessary to use. This is
just a tiny helper utility to help tidy up some type checking code. If you would
prefer not to introduce additional scripts/dependencies, it's simple enough to
write you own inline type checking, just like I did in some of my previous
posts.
