I originally started working on a generic AJAX query utility (I'll update this
post with a link when it is ready) when I remembered how tedious and verbose
simple input paramater validation and type checking can be. So I had a change of
heart and will be working on a type checking and assertion library instead. I
think will be useful - but I admit, I attempted this once before and my
resulting library was too verbose, and I ultimately ended up scrapping the
utility, because it didn't elimnate as much boiler plate as I had hoped. With
the introduction of modern JavaScript to ServiceNow server-side script, I'm
going to give it another shot.

## API Structure and Goals

First of all, the API needs to be concise and it needs to be very clear at a
glance what validation/checking is being performed. I'm going to take a note out
of other testing and assertion libraries, like Chai, Jest, Mocha, etc... and
attempt to build a fluent, chainable API. As an example, I'd like to be able to
do something similar to
`Type.check(value).isType('string').matches(/regex/).guard();`

For the most part, I think reading this is pretty self explanatory. `Type` is
the overall API name, and we check to make sure the value is a string and
matches some regex. Finally, the `guard` method - a name I'm not completely sold
on yet - can be used to throw an exception if the checks aren't passed or
omitted to perform the validation without throwing.
