I originally started working on a generic AJAX query utility (I'll update this
post with a link when it is ready) when I remembered how tedious and verbose
simple input paramater validation and type checking can be. So I had a change of
heart and will be working on a type checking and assertion library instead. I
think will be useful - but I admit, I attempted this once before and my
resulting library was too verbose, and I ultimately ended up scrapping the
utility, because it didn't elimnate as much boiler plate as I had hoped. With
the introduction of modern JavaScript to ServiceNow server-side script, I'm
going to give it another shot.

## API structure and goals

First of all, the API needs to be concise and it needs to be very clear at a
glance what validation/checking is being performed. I'm going to take a note
from other testing and assertion libraries, like Chai, Jest, Mocha, etc... and
attempt to build a fluent, chainable API. As an example, I'd like to be able to
do something similar to
`Type.check(value).isType('string').matches(/regex/).guard();`

For the most part, I think reading this is pretty self explanatory. `Type` is
the overall API name, and we check to make sure the value is a string and
matches some regex. Finally, the `guard` method - a name I'm not completely sold
on yet - can be used to throw an exception if the checks aren't passed or
omitted to perform the validation without throwing.

## Notable features and design choices

The inner workings of this utility is pretty simple, but very verbose, simply
due to the number of checks, branches, and chaining methods implemented. For
brevity's sake, I'm just going to call out some of the high-level features
implemented and design choices I made, then focus on the actual usage of the API
itself.

### Real classes - or, as real as they can be in JS

ServiceNow script includes rely on `prototype.js` for the native class
implementation. Although I typically prefer simple namespaced methods to classes
in ServiceNow, because I wanted a fluent, chainable API with persistent state
across method calls, a class was an obvious fit for this use case - but I
decided to take a different approach.

Since ServiceNow finally supports modern JavaScript, I leveraged a standard
JavaScript class. As long as the class name matches the script include name,
it's accessible like any other script include. This brings a couple benefits I
wanted to leverage - it doesn't depend on prototype, making the code more
portable, and I can leverage standard class features like getters and setters. A
getter allows an `not` property to be exposed to invert the result of a check,
rather than requiring our users to call a `not()` method, so we can write
something like `Type.check(value).not.type('string')` rather than
`Type.check(value).not().isType('string')`.

The standard class syntax will be more familiar to anyone that has done work
outside of ServiceNow, which is a plus. I created the
[TypeChecker](/code/servicenow/TypeChecker.js) class to store the type
validation, assertion, and error handling logic.

### The Façade

Even with the advent of ES6 classes, I'm still not generally a fan. I find they
are often misused or used when a simple collection of standalone functions would
suffice. It's a minor thing, but especially when a class is instantiated over
and over (as will be the case when validating many input parameters), the need
to call `new` repeatedly drives me crazy. For these reasons, I also created a
server-side namespace named [Type](/code/servicenow/Type.js). The `Type`
namespace contains some standalone methods, like retrieving additional details
on an object type, but importantly exposes a factory function called `check`
which instantiates the TypeChecker behind the scenes.

In my opinion, this makes the developer experience much better. All type related
methods can be accessed through the unified `Type` namespace. The code below
shows what the API looks like with and without using the façade.

```js
// using the TypeChecker directly
new TypeChecker.check(name, value).is.type("string").guard();

// using the Type namespace
Type.check(name, value).is.type("string").guard();

// the Factory could also take an object with a single key to simplify check(name, value)
Type.check({ value }).is.type("string").guard();
```
