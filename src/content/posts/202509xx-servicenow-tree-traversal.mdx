In the coming weeks, I'd like to start building out a library of reusable tree-traversal scripts. Tree traversal and
searching is a requirement that comes up frequently, so building a reusable utility is typically one of the first things
I do when I join a new team. Oddly enough, I have yet to work with a team that already had such utilities in place.

## Use cases

Tree data structures pop up all the time. In ServiceNow, an n-ary or generic tree is formed any time there is a table
with a reference field that references itself. Some examples of this are the User table manager column and the location
table parent location column. Imagine you wanted to perform an operation on all users that reported up to the same vice
president or find the first location under a specific state matching certain conditions. This is where tree algorithms
come into play.

## Why build reusable tree utilities?

I am not a fan of solving the same problem more than twice. I'm even less of a fan of multiple team members solving the
same problem in very different ways - this is a great way for overlooked edge cases and bugs to sneak into our
solutions. By abstracting the more complex tree traversal and search logic in a utility, it saves time, reduces bugs,
and allows developers to focus on solving their specific use case.

## Tree Types

Though there are more types and sub-categories of trees, the two most common you will come across are binary trees and
n-ary, or generic, trees. In a binary tree, each parent node has at most two child nodes. In an n-ary tree, each node
can have 0-n child nodes - like a self referencing one-to-many reference field.
