In the coming weeks, I'd like to start building out a library of reusable
tree-traversal scripts. Tree traversal and searching is a requirement that comes
up frequently, so building a reusable utility is typically one of the first
things I do when I join a new team. Oddly enough, I have yet to work with a team
that already had such utilities in place.

## Use cases

Tree data structures pop up all the time. In ServiceNow, an n-ary or generic
tree is formed any time there is a table with a reference field that references
itself. Some examples of this are the User table manager column and the location
table parent location column. Imagine you wanted to perform an operation on all
users that reported up to the same vice president or find the first location
under a specific state matching certain conditions. This is where tree
algorithms come into play.

## Why build reusable tree utilities?

I am not a fan of solving the same problem more than twice. I'm even less of a
fan of multiple team members solving the same problem in very different ways -
this is a great way for overlooked edge cases and bugs to sneak into our
solutions. By abstracting the more complex tree traversal and search logic in a
utility, it saves time, reduces bugs, and allows developers to focus on solving
their specific use case.

## Tree Types

Though there are more types and sub-categories of trees, the two most common you
will come across are binary trees and n-ary, or generic, trees. In a binary
tree, each parent node has at most two child nodes. In an n-ary tree, each node
can have 0-n child nodes - like a self referencing one-to-many reference field.

## Core Functions

Our tree traversal utility should provide a few core functions. Things that I
know we'll need of the top of my head are listed below.

- Get the root node
- Get sibling nodes
- Get child nodes
- Traverse to the root node
- Traverse all child nodes recursively using
  [Depth First Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search)
- Traverse all child nodes recursively using
  [Breadth First Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search)

Finally, it's usually not very helpful to simply traverse all nodes - we want to
take some action on each node. When writing utilities like this, we don't know
what that action is ahead of time. For each of our traversal methods, we'll need
to take a callback function as an input (like `Array.forEach`), that we can then
execute against each node.

## Next Steps

I'm going to keep this post brief and build out the core functions in separate
posts. I haven't been thinking been thinking about programming much recently, due to 
the release of a little game called Hollow Knight: Silksong. I don't play as much as 
I used to, but I'm hooked, so progress on tree traversal utility scripts may be slow going
for a couple weeks. I'll continue to update this post with links to the core functions as
I build them, so be sure to check back later.
