Welcome to covalt.dev - the third (hopefully final) attempt at me launching a personal website where I plan to share all my technology focused ramblings.

## Why Now?

I've been working in the technology sector for around twenty years in a variety of roles. I have always had a passion for continuous learning and I enjoy sharing what I have learned to help my team grow. I recently decided to branch out beyond my immediate team members and share my experience with a broader community, just like so many others that have helped me.

```javascript file=../scripts/snippet.js
```

## Wait, this is the third attempt?

Yes. Admittedly, the first two attempts were half-hearted and my motivation has shifted substantially since then. I plan to write about that experience, my motivations, and when you should or should not recreate the wheel. The short version of that story is that I didn't really care about launching a site - I just wanted to learn a few new technologies I hadn't worked with before (Golang/HTMX). When my personal goals were met, I didn't feel compelled to make additional posts.

## Will this time be any different?

I hope so! My goals have changed and I'm motivated to share my experience with others. This site isn't about me learning a fancy new framework or technology - though that is a great too! It's about launching a functional site to share my experience with others. Rather than choosing a tech stack based on what I wanted to learn, I'm choosing a tech stack makes it easy to publish and maintain content long term. While I can't promise I will post on a consistent basis, I do expect the site to remain online and functional this time.

## What's next?

Now that I actually have my site published and stable, it's time to start making some content! I'll probably start by going into more detail about this site's tech stack compared to my previous sites and explain the rationale behind my decisions. I'll also likely post about any major features I build along the way, assuming they are interesting. Eventually, I would love to host a documentation site for the various modules, classes, and utilities that I build. Stay tuned!
