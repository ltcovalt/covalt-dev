I wanted to give a brief update on the current state of this site, discuss my
plans for the site before 2025 comes to a close, and reflect on my experience so
far.

## Current State

I'm reasonably happy with the current state of the site overall. I have a bunch
of features and content I want to add to the site, but given I have only been
working on this site for a few months in the little free time I have, I'm happy
to have a place I can use to at least start generating content. I'm generally
happy with the dynamic theme picker and overall UI for a starting point. From a
content perspective, I'm also happy with the process and remark/rehype plugins
that enable me to easily publish and share content and source code files.

The biggest feature I am currently missing for me to truly be proud of this site
is an interface for navigating documentation. Although I have been writing about
tools as I build them, there's currently nowhere to go find published utilities,
explore the various methods and features available, or see examples of how to
use them.

## Future Enhancements

Like I previously mentioned, the single most important thing to me right now is
building the UI to allow documentation to be easily navigated. This will be my
main focus to close out 2025, though with the holidays coming up, it remains to
be seen if that's a feasible target to get a working system implemented.

I'd also like to do some general cleanup of the UI, especially making the
homepage more appealing for mobile users. For example, I want to change the
recent posts section so that each post drops to its own row for smaller screens.
I have the post links dimmed by default, and there is a subtle scale & highlight
animation effect on hover - which never occurs on mobile, so they just appear
dim. For both desktop and mobile, I'd also like to add small product icons
(i.e., Astro, ServiceNow, Tailwind, etc.) to each post based on tags in each
post's front matter. And there's some smaller Remark/Rehype plugins I'd like to
build to make my code snippets nicer, like a button do download the full source,
adding a copy icon/animation, etc.

## Reflecting on my experience so far

I mentioned in my very first post that this was not my first time starting a
personal site. It is the first time I started a site with the primary motivation
of actually creating and sharing content, however. Previous efforts were
motivated solely by learning and experimenting. Because of that, this site has
already matured further than my previous attempts and has more content
published, so I'm calling it a success. I have been enjoying the process of
researching, building something, and writing about it - so I do think this is
something that I will continue to work on for some time, even if my output slows
eventually.

Something I did not expect was how much more motivated I am to work on the site,
knowing that someone _might_ read a post _eventually_. I can see the search
stats - in the last 30 days, 6 people have clicked a link to my site - so I know
I have effectively no visitors. And yet, this minuscule amount of pressure has
been enough to keep me going. Surprisingly, it's even made my development work
more enjoyable. Rather than aimlessly experimenting with new tech without an end
goal, I am more focused and have specific goals I am working towards. This site
isn't my dream project by any means, but it has given me the slight nudge I
needed to keep working on a project. Moving forward, I'll likely make all my
projects public and hopefully that gives me the slight motivation boost I need
to make my projects more useful to others. And who knows, maybe next year I'll
surpass 6 visitors.
