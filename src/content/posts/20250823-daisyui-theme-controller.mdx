import ThemeController from '@components/ThemeController/ThemeController.astro';

As an avid dark mode user, the first thing I do when visiting a website for the first time is look for a dark mode toggle.
If I can't find a toggle or theme selector within about 10 seconds, there is a non-insignificant chance that I will leave
the site and look for an alternative. For my personal projects, dark mode or theme support is among the very first things
I implement to prevent the unnecessary searing of my eyeballs. In this post, I'm going to detail how I (over?) engineered
the theme controller for this site. The finished product is below.

<div class="not-prose w-fit block mx-auto">
	<ThemeController />
</div>
